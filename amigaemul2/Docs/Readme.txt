IMPORTANT NOTICE: Picasso96 support in (Win)UAE would not be possible without
the support and generosity of Alexander Kneer and Tobias Abt. Please donate
to the Picasso96 team if you use P96 and UAE together.  NOTE: Amiga Forever
from Cloanto includes a full Picasso96 license already, which is even more
reason to support a long-time Amiga software company. Click on the Picasso96
link in the About page of the WinUAE GUI for more information.

Catweasel support
-----------------

- Windows driver installed: automatically detected
- No Windows driver installed and TVicPort
  - Windows 2000/XP/Vista: automatically detected

How to use hdtoolbox with full harddisk images
----------------------------------------------

Create hardfile normally or use harddisk image from your real Amiga but clear all
hardfile parameters except block size.(sectors, surfaces and reserved)

HDToolBox must be run with "uaehf.device"-parameter ("tools/hdtoolbox uaehf.device")

Amiga formatted harddisk support
--------------------------------

Requires Windows 2000 or newer with administrator privileges.

All Amiga formatted or empty drives (=zeroed partition table) are autodetected.
WinUAE does not care about interface type, drive can IDE or SCSI or even
memory card if Windows detects the drive in device manager.

Use uaehf.device to access the drive in HDToolBox.
Note that some versions of HDToolBox don't see drives with unit number > 6.
Remove some mounted harddrives (directory or hardware) to fix the problem.

WARNING: you can force all drives to be detected if you run WinUAE with
-disableharddrivesafetycheck command line parameter but be very careful.
Don't try to select and partition/format your Windows drive(s)!

NOTE: uaescsi.device or ASPI don't have anything to do with harddisk support.

Vsync-instructions
------------------
- works in fullscreen modes only
- select 50Hz or 100Hz refresh rate (PAL) or 60Hz/120Hz (NTSC)
- WinUAE skips every other frame if refresh rate is over 85Hz
- display driver must support refresh rate selection. VSync is not selectable
  if only available option in refresh rate selection box is "default"
- you can also select other refresh rates for "interesting" results :)
- your pc must be fast because missed frames will cause huge slowdown
- display emulation refresh rate must be set to "every frame"

CD32 emulation instructions:
----------------------------

Emulated:

- CDROM except CD audio fast forward and rewind (1) (2)
- 1Kb NVRAM (works just like console emulators' memory card)
- C2P
- Joypad (keys: /=RWD *=PLAY -=FFW 7=Green 9=Yellow 1=Red 3=Blue)
  You can use input-tab to configure pad mappings.

Notes:

- CD32 configuration: 68EC020, AGA, 2MB chip, 0 floppy drives
- CD32's NVRAM (build-in 1024 byte flash RAM) file location can be specified in ROM-tab.
- CD32 ROMs come with Amiga Forever 5.0+ or you can dump then from floppy drive extended CD32.
  Don't ask me for ROMs!
- If you have CD32 CD images, you can use daemon tools (http://www.daemon-tools.cc/) to mount them.
- Make sure harddrives panel is empty and uaescsi.device is disabled!

uaescsi.device instructions
---------------------------

- Makes your IDE ATAPI/SCSI CDROM drives available on Amiga side (1)
  Use Amiga CDFS, CDA players or CD burning software etc..
  (not tested with real SCSI drives)

1:
- requires working ASPI drivers or admin privileges (SPTI)
- no configuration option for drive selection yet.
2:
- no drive selection configuration yet, just insert disc in any drive and start WinUAE.


Action Replay 1 / 2 / 3 instructions
--------------------------------

- You need AR 1, AR 2 or 3 ROM (see below for rip instructions)
- Set path to Action Replay ROM file (ROM-tab, cartridge ROM)
- Freeze button = Page Up
- Don't use AR support to save game states, use build-in state save option instead.
  (much faster and compatible)
- WARNING: Action Replay don't like fast Amigas or 68020+ CPUs
  and max supported fast ram is 4MB.

Action Replay ROM Ripping instructions:

 Find A500 with Action replay-cardridge,
 press 'freeze'-button, write following:

 AR 1:

 lord olaf<RETURN>

 AR 2 and 3:

 may<RETURN>
 the<RETURN>
 force<RETURN>
 be<RETURN>
 with<RETURN>
 you<RETURN>
 new<RETURN> (AR 3 only)
 
 insert empty floppy disk into DF0:

 AR1: "sm ar1.rom,f00000 f10000"
 AR2: "sm ar2.rom,400000 420000"
 AR3: "sm ar3.rom,400000 440000"
 transfer ROM image to your PC


Improved debugger
-----------------

 - f-command extended:
    f without parameters = break when PC not in ROM and current instruction is not
    0x4ef9 (don't break when executing library jump tables) Great for finding start
    address of bootblock.
    f i = break when PC points to RTS/RTR/RTE-instruction
    f i <opcode> = break when PC points to instruction opcode <opcode>
    f <addr> = add/remove new breakpoint (max 8)
    fd = remove all breakpoints
    f <addr1> <addr2> = break when <addr1> <= PC <= <addr2>
 - W-command's value-parameter can be decimal 12345 or hexadecimal (0x12345 or $12345)
    write size is byte if val < 256, word if 255 > val < 65536 and long if val > 65535.
    (previous version's write size was always long and was limited to chip ram)
 - memwatch break points added, w <0-7> <address> <length> <r/w/rw> [<value>]
    break when address space between address and address + length is accessed and
    if accessed value = <value> R = break only on reads, W = writes, RW = both
 - i-command: interrups and traps combined, VBR supported
 - custom register dump -command added (e), dumps the contents of all existing registers
   between 0xdff000-0xdf1ff. ea = dump AGA color register contents.
 - CIA dump-output slightly modified, added TOD stopped status-flag and more.
 - exiting debugger automatically creates "memory state" and b-command can be used
   to "rewind"
 - bl lists all stored "state recorder" states
 - search-command s <"string">/<hexvalues> [<addr]> [<length>]
 - trace (t <cnt>) can be used to step over more than one instruction
 - wd = enable illegal access logger (all read or write accesses to nonexisting memory,
   read access to write-only memory or vice versa, accesses to "unofficial" cia and custom
   register address space etc..)
 - wd x y = disable logging between addresses x to x + y
 - H = list last 50 PC addresses (HH = addresses + flags). Only available if any breakpoint
   is enabled.

Drive sound customization
-------------------------

You can use external samples if you put files called drive_click_xxx.wav,
drive_spin_xxx.wav, drive_startup_xxx.wav and drive_snatch_xxx.wav
(xxx = whatever you want, "click" is the only mandatory sample)
to directory called <winuae path>\uae_data\

Multimouse
----------

Windows 2000: no real multimouse support.
Windows XP/Vista/7: all mice are supported.

Open Input-tab. Select any manual configuration (Configuration #1 to #4)
Open device select box. You should see "Mouse *", "Windows mouse" and
2 or more "Raw Mouse" (XP-only, Vista/7 name can be also "HID compliant
mouse). Make sure "Mouse *" and "Windows mouse" are disabled, (select box
next to device select box is unchecked) enable other mice and make sure
mappings are correct.

New in 0.9.90: Multimouse can be configured in "Game & I/O-Ports"-panel,
there is no need to do complex Input-panel configuration anymore.

Windows mouse?
--------------

"Windows mouse" is mouse that gets all movement events from Windows'
desktop mouse instead of DirectInput. Enable "Windows mouse" if you
think mouse feels sluggish compared to older WinUAE before DirectInput
was implemented. (and don't forget to disable "Mouse *" first or
mouse movement will be quite erratic..) Can't be used in multimouse
configuration.

Mousehack mouse?
--------------

Needed when using Tablets. Tablets only work properly if you select
"Mousehack mouse" and run Amiga-side program "mousehack". Without
mousehack "Mousehack mouse" is equal to "Windows mouse".
(mousehack-program is needed because regular mouse sends relative
movement data but Tablets are absolute devices)

WinUAE 1.3 update: mousehack-program is now built-in.

Mouse *?
--------

"Mouse *" is DirectInput system default mouse. "Mouse *" gets all
combined events from all connected physical mice. Can't be used
in multimouse configuration.


New ROM config entries in 1.1:
------------------------------

Syntax:
 kickstart_rom=v<ver>[.<rev>] [r<subver>.<subrev>] [<model>]
Only <ver> is mandatory. Model must be specified if requested
ROM file is not a regular Kickstart ROM.
Examples:
 v1.3 (select any autodetected 1.3)
 v1.2 r33.166 (must be KS1.2 revision 33.166)
 v1.2 A500 (KS1.2 rev 33.180)
 v2.05 A600HD (KS 2.05, rev 37.350 or 37.300)
 v3.1 r40.68 A1200 (KS 3.1 rev 40.68 A1200)
 v3.1 r40.68 (KS 3.1 rev 40.68, both A1200 or A4000 version allowed)
 v3.1;v3.0 (any revision of KS 3.1 or 3.0)
 v3 A1200 (A1200 KS 3.1 or 3.0)
 v2 AR (any Action Replay v2)
Multiple matches: highest available version is selected
Extended ROM config item: kickstart_ext_rom=
Cartridge ROM config item: cart=
Arcadia ROMs:
cart=Arcadia <name>, for example cart=Arcadia Xenon

- Memory corruption in configuration file handling causing random
  crashes when loading or saving configuration files.
- Configuration files in subdirectories didn't load if configuration
  cache was enabled.
- RTG hardware mouse cursor may have been invisible (or had
  wrong graphics) in some cases after resolution change.
- Switching between non-interlaced and interlaced modes caused random
  "scanline" graphics corruption.

Other bug fixes:

- Built-in HRTMon crashed in JIT modes.

- FIXED:   Fix garbage display on Venus the Flytrap and Nightbreed Interactive
           Movie. (Toni Wilen)
- FIXED:   Trying to delete a non-empty directory will now properly return
           ERROR_DIRECTORY_NOT_EMPTY. (Bernd Roesch)
- FIXED:   Renaming a directory which was opened then closed will no longer
           crash. (Bernd Roesch)
- FIXED:   Increased the range of addresses checked for memory-mapping, in
           order to make JIT "direct" mode work on more systems. (Bernd
           Roesch)
- FIXED:   Selecting a Picasso96 8-bit mode in windowed-mode would complain
           about not matching your desktop's depth, and switch to full-screen.
- FIXED:   CD-ROM Mounting should work again.
- FIXED:   Installer won't install when WinUAE is already running.
- FIXED:   Right-click and "Editting" a .UAE config-file will now result in
           the correct config-name and config-description in the GUI.
- FIXED:   MIDI-Out won't crash external MIDI drivers like "hubies loopback".
           (Bernd Roesch)
- ADDED:   Jose's modifications to the sound routines and GUI. (Jose Gil)
           NOTE: Read doc called "SoundSyncro Readme.rtf"
- ADDED:   AHI driver support. (Bernd Roesch)
- ADDED:   Option to disable use of overlays completely.
- CHANGED: Floppy-disk emulation, including .FDI support. (Toni Wilen)

WinUAE 0.8.17 Release 2
==============================================================================
- FIXED:   Fixed the center_image() routine which was causing crashes with
           centering inside of screens less than 800x600.
- FIXED:   Remove hard dependency on RegisterDeviceNotification API so that
           WinUAE still works on Win95.
- FIXED:   Event timing works better now, and shouldn't hang any demos or
           games. (Bernd Schmidt)
- FIXED:   Max out at 512-Megs of ZorroIII RAM, since 1-Gig won't work.
- FIXED:   Merged in some CIA-related save-state changes. (Bernd Schmidt)
- FIXED:   Banshee AGA and Lemmings3 AGA are now mostly working, thanks to
           new delay-offset code.  See the "KNOWN BUGS" section above for
           further details. (Toni Wilen)
- FIXED:   Sound-syncro settings can be changed on-the-fly. (Jose Gil)
- ADDED:   New version of "uaediskchange" utility.  Put this inside your
           "Amiga" installation, and call it in your startup-sequence like
           "run >nil: c:uaediskchange cd0:" to watch cd0: for disk-changes.
           You can watch more than one drive. (Bernd Roesch)
- CHANGED: Tweaked the sound-syncro code again. (Jose Gil)
- CHANGED: Creating an AmigaDOS .adf file from the GUI will now create a
           formatted disk. (Toni Wilen)
- REMOVED: No restriction on only being able to run one instance of WinUAE.
           NOTE: USE THIS WITH CAUTION.
______________________________________________________________________________
WinUAE 0.8.17 Release 1
==============================================================================
- FIXED:   Various AGA and chipset-related fixes. (Bernd#1, Toni Wilen)
- FIXED:   .GZ support in floppy dialog doesn't cause corruption. (Timothy)
- FIXED:   Updated sprite-collision logic which fixes Leander, Archon 1 and 2,
           Menace, etc. (Toni)
- FIXED:   Updated disk-emulation code, for higher compatability.  Also now
           supports .fdi and high-density .adf images. (Toni, Adil Temel)
- FIXED:   60Hz support in Dynablaster and BC Kid (Toni Wilen)
- FIXED:   BSD-Socket emulation is mostly working, although bugs still exist.
           (Bernd#3)
- FIXED:   Picasso96 screens smaller than their display-mode would have crap
           in their left-hand-border if you grabbed the screen's title-bar and
           moved the screen to the right.
- FIXED:   Updated copy of rtg.library, including more patches. (Bernd#3)
- FIXED:   You can set the WinUAE resolution in full-screen to whatever you
           desire.  Especially useful so that you set your full-screen size to
           match your desktop size, and it will prevent all your desktop icons
           from moving around after exitting WinUAE. (me, Georg)
- FIXED:   Stupid sound_channels=0 stuff in config-files works properly.
- FIXED:   Stupid gfx_center_xxx=yes/no stuff in config-files works properly.
- FIXED:   Selecting an item in the Hard Drives page of the GUI and then
           moving its position in the list now leaves the item highlighted.
- FIXED:   Detect OS version early, and inform the user appropriately instead
           of crashing.  Windows NT is no longer a supported OS for WinUAE.
- FIXED:   Various little off-by-one pixel errors in the GUI.
- FIXED:   MIDI in/out lists in the Ports page of GUI were behaving strangely.
- FIXED:   Floppy-disc emulation change to allow Shadow of the Beast Trainer
           to work. (Toni Wilen)
- FIXED:   Small change in MIDI support so that closing MIDI and then
           reopening it will work properly. (Bernd Roesch)
- FIXED:   Call ahi_install in main.c.  No Amiga-side AHI driver yet.
- FIXED:   MIDI-input doesn't have the concept of a "default device", unlike
           MIDI-output.  Changed the GUI and programming accordingly.
- FIXED:   MIDI-output now does the right things with the serial-port after
           each written byte, which allows some other programs to finally
           work (MusicX, Deluxe Music, etc.)
- ADDED:   New hook function in uaelib for checking on removable drive state.
- ADDED:   Disk-change status is now tracked via WM_DEVICECHANGE notifications
           which allows "run >nil: uaediskchange cd0:" in the startup-sequence
           to work properly.  Eject a CD-ROM, and the Amiga knows about it.
           Insert a new CD-ROM, and the Amiga knows about it.  Woo-hoo!
           NOTE: Probably really buggy.
- ADDED:   New collision-modes, fast-copper mode (not save-able with config).
- ADDED:   State-save support. (Toni Wilen)
- ADDED:   Option in Sound page of GUI to enable/disable synchronized sound.
- ADDED:   Printing of DDCAPS info for display-driver, to help diagnostics.
- ADDED:   FDI disk-image support (Toni Wilen)
- CHANGED: Tweaked the sound-code yet again, hopefully will get less out of
           sync.  (Jose Gil, myself)
- CHANGED: Add PC Drives no longer adds the floppy-drives.  If you want access
           to A:, then you'll have to add it manually in the GUI.
- CHANGED: Added ability to allocate larger amount of ZorroIII memory. 
           (Bernd#3)
- CHANGED: Added ability to allocate larger amount of RTG (Picasso96) memory.
           (Bernd#3)
- CHANGED: Removed Vertical Blank Synchronization (VSync) support in Flip
           calls.  This should increase synchronization and performance in
           full-screen mode, but may introduce some tearing/artifacting.
- CHANGED: Use the system "hand" cursor when pointing at web-links in the
           About page (if available). (Oscar Sillani)
- CHANGED: Use Tahoma font in About page of GUI.
- CHANGED: Use up/down icons in the HardDisk page of GUI. (Oscar Sillani)
______________________________________________________________________________
WinUAE 0.8.16 Release 4
==============================================================================
- FIXED: 50Hz/60Hz switching (B.C. Kid) works again. (Toni Wilen)
- FIXED: Various Picasso96 issues. (Bernd Roesch)
- FIXED: F11 should be '\' again.
- ADDED: .GZ support in floppy dialog. (Timothy Roughton, aka Inner) 
- CHANGED: Tweaked the sound-code yet again, hopefully will be less choppy.
- CHANGED: Tweaked the exception-handling code for JIT. (Bernie Meyer)
- REMOVED: icon1.ico from the source-code archive.
______________________________________________________________________________
WinUAE 0.8.16 Release 3
==============================================================================
- FIXED: GUI DLL loader is no longer fixated on Deutsch.
- FIXED: Selecting 68000 CPU from a JIT config doesn't result in error message.
- ADDED: Sprite-collisions can be enabled/disabled during emulation, not just
         at startup.
- ADDED: Patched rtg.library added to package, which should fix the mouse trails.
         (Thanks to Tobias Abt and Alexander Kneer of P96, and Bernd Roesch).
		 This file (rtg.library) will end up in the "Amiga Programs/" directory
		 under the "WinUAE/" directory where you install to.
- ADDED: German keymap (UAE_German)
- ADDED: uaediskchange utility
- ADDED: French and German DLLs updated, Italian DLL added.  (Thanks Georg V,
         FagEmul, and Daniele G)
- CHANGED: Tweaked the sound code again, memory-leak should be gone, performance
           should be better - expect a speed decrease when using JIT and sound.
- CHANGED: Graphics glitches caused by NOVSYNC flipping should be gone in full-
           screen mode.
- REMOVED: Turkish DLL, as it was out-of-date
______________________________________________________________________________
WinUAE 0.8.16 Release 2
==============================================================================
- FIXED: Stupid shift-key issue (me)
- FIXED: Should be back to 50Hz at A500 speed emulation, so audio latency should
         be reduced or non-existant. (me)
- FIXED: Graphics-updates may work now on Voodoo cards (Toni, me)
- FIXED: Updated file-version info in WinUAE.exe resource. (Georg)
- FIXED: Bug with version-number checking and GUI DLLs (Georg)
______________________________________________________________________________
WinUAE 0.8.16 Release 1
==============================================================================
- FIXED: Better 040 compatibility (Toni, Bernd#3, Gwenole)
- FIXED: Even more 040 and debugger compatibility (Toni, Bernd#3, Gwenole)
- FIXED: Fixed the cleanup_sound() routine to not crash on some systems (Andreas)
- FIXED: AGA support (Toni)
- FIXED: Don't die on CPUs (Cyrix) which don't have rdtsc instruction
- FIXED: Printing from within FinalWriter (Bernd#3)
- FIXED: Graphics printing should work now. (Bernd#3)
- FIXED: Translated GUI libraries are only loaded if their version number is
         0.8.16.1 now, so that the GUI is consistent across languages for a
         given WinUAE version.
- FIXED: Horizontal/vertical lines are 2x faster in Picasso96 (Bernd#3)
- FIXED: Floppy disk emulation tweaks (Toni Wilen)
- FIXED: Auto-activation of WinUAE window is smarter now.
- FIXED: Bug with flipping surfaces in DirectDraw.  If the flipping-pair was
         not properly created (say the primary was in video-ram, but the
         secondary was in system-ram) and cannot be flipped, we tried to
         flip anyways.  This would fill up the log with flip-failure reports.
- FIXED: Infinite loops when GetBytesPerPixel fails.  Still looking into why
         GetBytesPerPixel fails in some weird circumstances.
- FIXED: "more compatible" string in CPU page of GUI is no longer too long.
- FIXED: Mouse-pointer reappears when message-boxes pop up.
- FIXED: Mouse-button state isn't kept across screen-mode changes (Bernd#3)
- FIXED: Clear the write-protect bit when copying files from read-only media.
         This fixes the icon overwrite problem when installing OS 3.5 and 3.9.
         (Bernd#3)
- FIXED: Added a hack for volume-names of "AmigaOS3.5" and "AmigaOS3.9" to be
         used even though Windows shows "AmigaOS35" and "AmigaOS39". (Bernd#3)
- FIXED: Make sure that the Windows mouse-pointer is not active on an Amiga
         screen-mode switch. (Bernd#3)
- FIXED: Fixed timing problems on SpeedStep mobile processors, due to their
         strange RDTSC implementation being variable.  Instead, use the OS
         provided QueryPerformanceCounter(), which actually works but
         has much lower resolution.
- FIXED: Framerate reporting. (Toni)
- FIXED: Maximum number of Picasso96 screen-modes is increased.
- FIXED: Screen refresh bug when minimizing/maximizing full-screen Amiga gfx.
- FIXED: Now use gzip.dll for .adz/.roz handling.
- FIXED: Floppy disks can be written/formatted again.
- FIXED: Disk-select logic for certain demos (Toni)
- FIXED: Bogus printer loading when printer is "none" in GUI.
- FIXED: Incorrect block-size reporting for HardDiskFiles (.hdf) in GUI
- FIXED: Keyboard stickiness during screen-switches, and/or F12 GUI. (Bernd#3)
- ADDED: JIT support for massive speed increase (Bernd#2)
- ADDED: "mixed stereo" setting in the Sound page of the GUI.
- ADDED: "CTRL-F11 to quit" setting in Misc page of the GUI.  ALT-F4 can then
         be used by the Amiga properly, and CTRL-F11 will quit WinUAE.
- ADDED: Virtual screens in Picasso96 (Bernd Roesch)
- ADDED: MIDI-In support (Bernd Roesch)
- CHANGED: Slightly different compile flags, resulting code may be faster (?)
- CHANGED: Moved the Immediate Blit option from Misc to Display page of GUI
- CHANGED: Use some of WinFellow's fsdb code in WinUAE.
- CHANGED: Picasso96 rendering/display engine (Larry, Curly, me)
- CHANGED: AIAB web-link in About page of GUI.
- REMOVED: 32-bit Blitter option is gone now (no longer applies)
- REMOVED: 24-bit display-mode support.
- REMOVED: Enforcer-logging option in Misc page of GUI
- REMOVED: DirectDraw6 option in Misc page of GUI (now the default)
- REMOVED: NT4 support.
______________________________________________________________________________
WinUAE 0.8.14 Release 3
==============================================================================
- FIXED: Stupid frames-per-second bug whenever the GUI has been displayed.
- FIXED: Graphics garbage at bottom of Amiga screens whenever the GUI is
         displayed and moved around (in windowed-mode).
- FIXED: Enabling "Show LEDs in full-screen" once running didn't actually work.
- FIXED: Speed of emulation is no longer "crazy" when sound is disabled.
- FIXED: Crashing with certain .uae config-files, including default.uae.
- FIXED: Minimizing WinUAE and then restoring it wasn't restoring sound.
- FIXED: Screen refresh bug when minimizing/maximizing full-screen Amiga gfx.
- FIXED: Now use gzip.dll (included) for .adz/.roz handling.
- ADDED: Can now adjust sound preferences while the emulation is running.
- ADDED: Turkish GUI DLL to installer
- CHANGED: Printing support in the GUI is now based on a printer-name, not a
           physical printer-port.  You MUST have a printer-driver on the Amiga
           side that matches your actual printer.
- REMOVED: Ability to adjust the floppy-disk speed.  This "feature" doesn't
           exist in the core UAE version, and can also cause incompatabilities.
______________________________________________________________________________
WinUAE 0.8.14 Release 3 (the Stupid release)
==============================================================================
- FIXED: Stupid bug with GUI (F12) when in full-screen mode.
- FIXED: Stupid Picasso96 slow-down in Release 2

==============================================================================
- FIXED: Picasso96 screen-modes weren't being drawn/updated correctly.
- FIXED: Sound-buffer slider gets disabled when no audio output is selected.
- FIXED: German GUI DLL is accurate now. (Thanks Georg)
- ADDED: Flicker-free Amiga screen updates when full-screen.  Doesn't affect
         Picasso96 screens, though.
- CHANGED: Sound output tweaked again, should be "slightly" better.
______________________________________________________________________________
WinUAE 0.8.14 Release 1
==============================================================================
- FIXED: When WinUAE is full-screen, the Message dialog-box no longer "hides"
         and locks up WinUAE.  Instead, WinUAE will automatically minimize
         itself and display the dialog-box on the Windows Desktop.
- FIXED: log-file no longer fills up with blit failure reports.
- FIXED: Some resources (critical-sections, threads) weren't being cleaned-up.

         text, html, or screen-shots to a particular configuration.
- ADDED: German localization of the GUI. (Georg Veichtlbauer)
- ADDED: "Back To The Roots" link in About page of GUI. (Bobic)
- CHANGED: All audio goes through WaveOut octal-buffering now.
- CHANGED: Hard-disk to local filesystem translation-layer.  MAY BE BUGGY NOW!
- CHANGED: Native CD-ROM drives are mounted as CDx: instead of DHx:
- CHANGED: Frames-per-second are only displayed in Amiga screen-modes now.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For general information about the core UAE platform, refer to:

http://www.freiburg.linux.de/~uae/

This readme file does _not_ cover the features of UAE that are common to
all versions. If you're not familiar with UAE yet, consulting the generic
distribution before attempting to use this port might actually not be a
bad idea.

The generic UAE documentation can be found in the docs directory of this
archive. Take these docs with a grain of salt, though: Not every detail of the
Linux documentation pertains to WinUAE, and vice versa.

The latest release of UAE for Win32 is available from:
http://www.winuae.net/

Also, excellent English *and* German help-files in Compiled HTML Manual (.chm)
format can be found at http://www.winuae.net/download.htm.  Many thanks
to Georg Viechtlbauer for his help with this!

If you are using Windows 95 (shame on you!) and don't have DirectX
installed yet, you need to grab and install a copy first. UAE works
with older versions of DirectX, so chances are that you won't have
any problems if you had installed a DirectX game on your machine at
least once.

There are no problems running WinUAE under Windows 2000 and XP - in fact,
Win2K or XP is the best platform to run WinUAE on - providing the best
graphics and network performance, as well as core emulation duties.

Windows NT 4.0 is not supported

| BUG REPORTS VIA EMAIL: Please make sure that the following conditions are
| met before you report any kind of problem:
|
| (1) You are using the latest version of WinUAE
| (2) You have read the documentation (90% of all potential questions are
|     answered thoroughly in the this readme file)
| (3) You have used your brain
| (4) The graphics drivers of your systems are up-to-date 
|
| If you do write me, _always_ state what version of UAE your feedback is
| pertaining to. Include all the necessary information, e.g. the command
| line options you are using.
|
| Do _not_ send me warez of any kind, no matter how non-working they are.
| Do _NOT_ ask me for ROM-files, warez, etc.

1. Command Line Parameters
==========================
UAE's command line options are now quite hidden, since we're a true
Windows application now (and not a console-application).

The most important one is:
  -config=configfile.uae
or this will also work:
  -f configfile.uae

which will cause WinUAE to load the saved config-file (which is just
ASCII format anyways).

2. File-System Specifics
========================
UAE will try its best to bridge the gap between Microsoft and Tripos file
system semantics, but there are some inherent limitations:

1. The Windows "read only" flag controls the w and d bits on the Amiga side
2. r and e are always set
3. h, s and p cannot be set
4. The a flag is preserved
5. File comments are not supported
6. Not all file names that are "forbidden" under the lame Windows fs are
   being handled correctly yet. The most common ones, however, are.

Beware: UAE does _not_ live in a chroot-like environment! There is no
checking for accesses to directories above the mount point. Do not
assume that your data is absolutely safe from rogue Amiga programs!

3. Keyboard Emulation
=====================
Most of your keyboard retains its regular functionality under UAE, but
there are a few notable exceptions:

- if you don't have a Win95 keyboard, you'll have to use Ins/Home as a
  replacement for Left Amiga/Right Amiga (this is different from other
  versions of UAE).
- HELP has been remapped to Page-Down
- F12 brings up the GUI
- Shift+F12 brings up the GUI-based debugger
- Scroll Lock toggles screen refresh, speeding up the emulation
- Pause toggles sound, speeding up the emulation (note that you can't
  enable sound this way if you haven't configured UAE to run with sound
  from the beginning).
- End+F1, F2, F3 or F4 allows you to change disks in one of the four
  Amiga disk drives. Shift+End+F1...F4 ejects the disk.

The keyboard replacements for an Amiga joystick are as follows:

                 a              b            c
Up            Keypad 8      Cursor Up        T
Down          Keypad 2     Cursor Down       B
Left          Keypad 4     Cursor Left       F
Right         Keypad 6     Cursor Right      H
Fire          Keypad 0      Right Ctrl    Left Alt

WinUAE supports gzip-compressed disk images if you have zlib.dll.

Windows 2000/XP users: Using the compression feature of NTFS instead
of gzip is a good idea if you wish to save space and be able to write
to the ADF files at the same time.

3. Performance Issues
=====================
On a sufficiently powerful PC, UAE will give you quite an authentic
flashback into a (better?) past.

Thanks to DirectX, the raw drawing throughput of this version will be
among the highest of all Intel ports. 800x600 is only about 20% slower
than 320x200 on my Pentium 100, although it requires more than seven
times as many bytes per second to be pumped across the PCI bus. UAE's
native display depth is 16 bpp. This table shows how the net drawing
speed is affected by your display type:

16 bpp full screen - 100%
16 bpp desktop     -  98% 
24 bpp desktop     -  72%
32 bpp desktop     -  60%

Sound is a luxury. Because sound output is strictly synchronized with
video DMA, you _won't_ get clean sound _unless_ your machine is capable
of running at 50 fps at least internally.

Rule of thumb: Get a PPro or Pentium II if you want full graphics and
full sound at the same time (reportedly, the Pentium MMX 200 MHz,
overclocked to 250 MHz [83.3 MHz bus speed], is a powerful platform
for running UAE. I have no definite reports about the K6 and the M2 yet,
but these should do pretty good as well.).

On a Pentium 100 equipped with a Matrox Millennium, UAE-Win32/DirectX
is slightly faster than the Linux version under AcceleratedX for programs
that perform a _lot_ of screen updates, i.e. action games and demos.
All other things should run at roughly the same speed.

4. Compatibility
================
The number of programs that don't run properly under UAE decreases with
every new release. If you find a piece of software to require special
treatment, please let me know. I have received copies of pirated software
in my email in the past. Never ever do this to me.

Consult compatibility.txt for tips on how to get software running and a
growing collection of user-submitted parameters.

A few broken programs require instruction prefetch and/or exception 3
to be emulated (e.g.  Shadow of the Beast I, Katakis and Denaris). These
can be forced to run by playing with the "compatible-mode" CPU-flag in
the CPU-settings section of the GUI.
